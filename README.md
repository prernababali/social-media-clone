A responsive, modern full-stack social media web application developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It replicates core functionalities of platforms like Facebook and Twitter — enabling user interaction through posts, comments, likes, and social followings, all within a secure, session-based authentication system.


##  Project Highlights
 showcases how full-stack concepts work in harmony — from database modeling and user authentication to frontend templating and stateful user sessions.

### Authentication & Security
- Local authentication via **Passport.js** using username & password
- Middleware (`ensureAuth`) to protect all internal routes
- **Session management** using `express-session` and persistent PostgreSQL-based storage

###  User Social System
- Browse all registered users
- Send and manage **follow requests** (pending or accepted)
- View other users’ profile pages with their posts and statistics

### Post Feed
- Create and manage text-based posts
- See your posts and those from users you follow
- Post cards display author info, likes, and comments

### Like & Comment System
- Like/unlike any post with immediate feedback
- Comment with author & timestamp shown
- Clean UI experience with real-time visibility

### Personalized Dashboard
- Displays posts only from followed users + your own
- Sorted in reverse chronological order (latest first)
- Clean Bootstrap cards with structured content

### User Profile Page
- View profile details, follower/following count
- Upload and update **profile pictures via Cloudinary**
- Only logged-in users can view/edit profiles

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repo**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odinbook.git
   cd odinbook

2. Install dependencies
npm install
Set up environment


3. Create a .env file in the root with:
init
Copy
Edit
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/odinbook
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

4. Set up Prisma
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate

5. Run the app
npm run dev
Visit: http://localhost:3000


# What I Learned
1. Setting up full user authentication with Passport.js

2. Handling relational data (follows, comments, likes) with Prisma

3. Creating dynamic UI using EJS + Bootstrap

4. Managing media uploads via Cloudinary

5. Building secure, RESTful Express routes with session control

6. Designing social logic (feed, profile, permissions, follow logic)
